How to build, run, and configure an NSchema application from code. New to NSchema? Start with
the [Embedding the engine](/library/embedding/) walkthrough, then come back here.

## Building and running

The builder should be familiar to any developer who's used ASP.NET.
`NSchemaApplication.CreateBuilder(...)` produces a builder that you can configure with your
target schema, database provider, configuration, logging, metrics, or any other .NET packages
that we've come to rely on — it uses a `HostApplicationBuilder` internally purely to compose
those.

Call `builder.Build()` to get an `NSchemaApplication`. It is not a long-running host; it's a
single-use object that runs one operation and exits. Run an operation by calling the matching
method on it (`Plan()`, `Apply()`, etc.). The operation `await`s directly, so exceptions
surface to you at the call site, and the application can only be run once.

## Operations

Each run performs one of the following operations, selected by the method you call on the built
application:

- **`Plan()`** computes and renders the plan, without touching the database. Can also write the
  plan to a file to apply later — see [Saved plan files](#saved-plan-files).
- **`Apply()`** computes the plan and applies it to the database. After a successful apply, the
  resulting schema is captured to the [state store](#backend-state-store) if one is configured.
  Can also apply a previously [saved plan file](#saved-plan-files) instead of recomputing.
- **`Refresh()`** reads the current schema from the live database and writes it to the state
  store, without planning or applying anything. Requires a state store.
- **`Import()`** reads the live database schema and writes it to the local filesystem as
  desired-schema source files — one `.sql` file per major object under
  `ImportArguments.OutputDirectory`. Useful for bootstrapping a project from an existing
  database.
- **`Validate()`** loads the desired schema and validates it against the configured schema
  policies, without planning or applying.
- **`Destroy()`** drops the managed schema objects from the database.

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();
await app.Apply(); // Runs the apply.
```

## Saved plan files

By default `Apply` recomputes the plan when it runs. You can instead save the plan from one run
and apply that exact file later — the analogue of `terraform plan -out` followed by `terraform
apply <planfile>`. This guarantees that what was reviewed is exactly what is applied, which is
useful when planning and applying happen in separate steps (for example, plan in a pull
request, apply after approval in CI).

Write a plan to a file with `PlanArguments.OutFile`, then apply it with `ApplyArguments.PlanFile`:

```csharp
// Step 1 — compute and save the plan (requires a registered SQL generator):
await app.Plan(new PlanArguments { OutFile = "migration.nplan" });

// Step 2 — later, apply exactly that plan without recomputing:
await app.Apply(new ApplyArguments { PlanFile = "migration.nplan" });
```

The file records the structured diff, the migration plan, and the generated SQL. Applying from
it reports the same diff/plan/SQL view a normal run would, then executes the saved SQL — it
does not re-read the database or re-plan. When `PlanFile` is set, `ApplyArguments.Schemas` is
ignored, since the saved plan already fixes its scope.

A teardown plan works the same way: save it with `PlanDestroyArguments.OutFile`, then apply it
through `Apply` (a saved teardown is just a saved plan):

```csharp
await app.PlanDestroy(new PlanDestroyArguments { OutFile = "teardown.nplan" });
await app.Apply(new ApplyArguments { PlanFile = "teardown.nplan" });
```

Saving a plan requires a registered SQL generator (to produce the SQL stored in the file). Plan
files are written to the local filesystem; they are not routed through the
[state store](#backend-state-store).

## Backend state store

By default, NSchema generates plans against the current live state of the database. This is
simple and works well for many scenarios, but you can't always guarantee that you'll have
access to the database at plan time. Sometimes it's desirable to generate a plan against the
last applied state instead, like generating migration scripts in a CI pipeline with no database
connection.

NSchema supports an optional backend state store that persists a snapshot of the schema. After
a successful apply, NSchema captures the resulting schema to the store, so a later plan can be
generated against that snapshot. You can also capture the current schema without applying by
running a [`Refresh`](#operations) operation — handy for recording drift that happened between
applies.

Register a state store from a provider package like `NSchema.Aws`, or use the built-in
`UseFileStateStore(path)` for a file-backed store:

```csharp
builder.UseFileStateStore("schema_state.json");
```

When a state store is registered, `Plan` operations automatically use it as the current-state
source (offline planning), and `Apply` operations always read from the live database. No
additional configuration is needed.

## Destructive action policy

By default, NSchema will error on any destructive actions (e.g. dropping tables or columns) to
prevent accidental data loss. You can change this behavior by configuring the
`DestructiveActionPolicy`:

```csharp
builder.WithDestructiveActionPolicy(DestructiveActionPolicy.Warn); // log a warning, but continue
builder.WithDestructiveActionPolicy(DestructiveActionPolicy.Allow); // allow without warning
```

If you need more advanced control, you can implement your own `IDiffPolicy` and register it
with `AddDiffPolicy<T>()`.

## Scoping to specific schemas

Pass a `Schemas` filter on the operation arguments to scope a run to a subset of schemas.
Useful for deploying schemas independently of one another:

```csharp
var app = builder
    .AddDdlSchemas("schemas")
    .UseCurrentSchemaPostgres(connectionString)
    .Build();

await app.Plan(new PlanArguments { Schemas = ["app"] });   // only "app" is read, validated, and diffed
```

Scope is a per-invocation argument (`PlanArguments` / `ApplyArguments` / `ValidateArguments` /
`DestroyArguments`), not ambient configuration. Declarations or drops for schemas outside the
scope are ignored, so unmanaged schemas in the database are never touched.

## Configuring desired schemas

The desired schema is declared in SQL DDL files (see [Defining schemas](/ddl/defining-schemas/)
and the [grammar reference](/ddl/grammar/)), loaded with `AddDdlSchemas`, which takes a base
directory and a glob pattern relative to it (the pattern defaults to `**/*.sql`):

```csharp
builder.AddDdlSchemas("schemas");
```

`AddDdlSchemas` may be called more than once and the sources are aggregated before planning, so
you can split a schema across many files (and directories) freely. Deployment scripts declared
inline in those files (`PRE/POST DEPLOYMENT`) are loaded at the same time.

For finer control — for example to exclude files reserved for other purposes — pass a
configured `Microsoft.Extensions.FileSystemGlobbing.Matcher`, which supports excludes as well
as includes:

```csharp
var matcher = new Matcher();
matcher.AddInclude("**/*.sql");
matcher.AddExclude("**/*.env.*.sql");   // e.g. environment-overlay files, layered in separately
builder.AddDdlSchemas("schemas", matcher);
```

## Configuring the current schema

The current schema is configured by registering a provider that can read the live state of the
database. This is typically done via a provider package like `NSchema.Postgres`:

```csharp
// Using a provider package:
builder.UseCurrentSchemaPostgres(connectionString);

// Or directly:
builder.UseCurrentSchema<PostgresSchemaProvider>();
```

See [Backend state store](#backend-state-store) for how to configure offline planning against a
persisted snapshot.

## Transaction mode

By default, NSchema runs the entire migration inside a single transaction to ensure that either
all changes are applied successfully or none at all. However, some databases don't support DDL
statements inside transactions, or you may have specific statements that need to run outside of
a transaction.

```csharp
builder.WithTransactionMode(TransactionMode.Single); // entire migration in one transaction (default)
builder.WithTransactionMode(TransactionMode.None);   // all statements outside transactions
```

## Output format

Run output is produced by an `IOperationReporter`. The built-in `default` reporter writes
human-readable output to the terminal. Register additional reporters by format key on the
builder, and select which one a run uses via `NSchemaApplicationOptions.Reporter`:

```csharp
var app = NSchemaApplication
    .CreateBuilder(new NSchemaApplicationOptions { Reporter = "json" })  // select the reporter
    .AddReporter<JsonReporter>("json")                                   // register it under that key
    .Build();
```

## SQL dialect

When more than one `ISqlGenerator` is registered (each declaring a `Dialect`), choose which one
generates the SQL for a run:

```csharp
builder
    .AddSqlGenerator<PostgresGenerator>("postgres")
    .AddSqlGenerator<MySqlGenerator>("mysql")
    .WithDialect("postgres");    // or set SqlOptions.Dialect
```

## Schema policies

Schema policies validate the desired schema before any comparison or planning is done:

```csharp
builder.AddSchemaPolicy<TableNamesMustBePluralPolicy>();
```

## Diff policies

Diff policies validate the structured diff between the current and desired schema before a plan
is built — this is where the built-in destructive-action policy runs. Register your own to
enforce additional rules:

```csharp
builder.AddDiffPolicy<NoDestructiveActionsPolicy>();
```

## Exception behavior

By default, NSchema will report any exceptions using `IOperationReporter` and then rethrow
them. You can change this behavior through `NSchemaApplicationOptions`, passed when you create
the builder:

```csharp
// report and rethrow exceptions (default)
var app = NSchemaApplication.CreateBuilder(new NSchemaApplicationOptions
{
    ExceptionBehavior = ExceptionBehavior.ReportAndThrow,
});

// rethrow exceptions without reporting
var app = NSchemaApplication.CreateBuilder(new NSchemaApplicationOptions
{
    ExceptionBehavior = ExceptionBehavior.Throw,
});
```

Either way the exception propagates out of the operation call (e.g. `await app.Apply()`), so
you can handle it and set a process exit code in your entry point.
